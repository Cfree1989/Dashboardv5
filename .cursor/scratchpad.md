- [ ] Production deployment configuration
- [ ] Documentation and training materials

## Current Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Advanced Features  
**Next Milestone**: Email Service Integration  
**Overall Progress**: ~60% complete

### Recently Completed Achievements:
âœ… **Complete V0 Design System Integration** - All pages now have professional, consistent styling  
âœ… **Student-Staff Access Separation** - Dashboard access properly restricted to staff only  
âœ… **Professional UI/UX** - Application looks and feels like a modern SaaS product  
âœ… **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop  
âœ… **Enhanced Accessibility** - Proper focus states, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation  

### Active Development:
âœ… **Tab Count Authentication Fix** - Fixed dashboard tabs not showing job counts due to missing authentication headers  
ðŸ”„ **Phase 4.1: Email Service Integration** - Implementing Flask-Mail with templates and background processing

## Phase 4.1: Email Service Integration (Current Focus)

**Goal**: Implement reliable email notifications for job confirmations and status updates  
**Estimated Time**: 60 minutes  
**Priority**: HIGH - Completes core user workflow

### Detailed Sub-Tasks:

1. **Configure Flask-Mail Setup (15 min)**
   - Add Flask-Mail to requirements.txt
   - Configure SMTP settings in app configuration
   - Set up environment variables for email credentials
   - Initialize Mail instance in app factory

2. **Create Email Templates (20 min)**
   - Design `submission_confirmation.html` template
   - Design `status_update.html` template  
   - Include professional styling and branding
   - Add responsive email design

3. **Implement EmailService Class (15 min)**
   - Create `backend/app/services/email_service.py`
   - Methods: `send_confirmation_email()`, `send_status_update()`
   - Template rendering with job data
   - Error handling for SMTP failures

4. **Add Background Task Processing (10 min)**
   - Configure Celery with Redis broker
   - Create email task functions
   - Add retry logic for failed sends
   - Implement proper logging

**Success Criteria**: 
- Students receive confirmation emails upon job submission
- Staff can trigger email resends through API
- All email sends are logged and tracked

## Next Steps Priority Queue

### Immediate (This Session):
1. **Phase 4.1: Email Service Integration** âš¡ HIGH
2. **Phase 5.1: Approval Modal** ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL for staff workflow

### Short-term (Next Session):  
3. **Phase 5.2-5.4: Remaining Job Management Modals**
4. **Phase 4.2: File Management System**

### Medium-term:
5. **Phase 6: Real-time Updates**
6. **Phase 4.3: Payment & Pickup Workflow**

## Technical Architecture Status

**Backend (Flask)**: âœ… Fully operational
- Authentication system with JWT tokens
- Complete job lifecycle API
- Database models and migrations
- Event logging and audit trails

**Frontend (Next.js)**: âœ… Professional V0 design
- Student submission form with validation
- Staff dashboard with responsive grid layout
- Professional error handling and loading states
- Consistent design system across all pages

**Database (PostgreSQL)**: âœ… Configured and seeded
- Job, Staff, Event, Payment models
- Database migrations working
- Test data available

**Docker Environment**: âœ… Operational
- All containers running correctly
- Development environment stable
- Hot reloading working

## Lessons Learned

- **V0 Design Integration**: Applying professional design systems dramatically improves perceived quality
- **Student Access Control**: Never provide dashboard links to student-facing pages
- **API Proxy Configuration**: Next.js rewrites essential for frontend-backend communication  
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build functional features first, then enhance with professional styling
- **Focus on Core Workflows**: Prioritize job submission â†’ approval â†’ completion flow above advanced features
- **Authentication Headers**: Always include Authorization headers in ALL API calls, including count fetches for tab badges

## Risk Assessment: LOW

**Why Low Risk**:
- Core functionality proven and working
- Professional UI complete and tested
- Clear separation between student and staff interfaces
- Well-defined API contracts
- Docker environment ensures consistency

**Current Blockers**: None identified

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 4.1 (Email Service Integration) to complete the core user experience workflow.
