# 3D Print Management System - Comprehensive Build Plan

## Background and Motivation

Based on the analysis of `masterplan.md`, `Rebuild.md`, `project-info.md`, and the system architecture diagrams, we are building a complete 3D Print Management System from absolute scratch. This system is designed for academic/makerspace environments with the following key requirements:

### Core System Requirements:
1. **Flask API-only backend** with PostgreSQL database
2. **Next.js frontend** with TypeScript and modern UI components
3. **Workstation-based authentication** with mandatory staff attribution
4. **Complete job lifecycle management** from submission to pickup
5. **File integrity and resilience** with metadata.json tracking
6. **Comprehensive audit trails** with Event logging
7. **Email notifications** and student confirmation workflows
8. **Custom protocol handler** for direct file opening in slicer software
9. **Docker-based deployment** for consistency and simplicity

### Key Design Principles:
- **Beginner-friendly implementation** with clear, step-by-step guidance
- **API-first design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Multi-user environment** supporting up to 2 staff workstations
- **File resilience** through standardized naming and metadata tracking
- **Professional UI/UX** following modern design patterns
- **Comprehensive error handling** and recovery mechanisms

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:
1. **File System Integrity**: Ensuring atomic file operations and recovery from partial failures
2. **Multi-User Concurrency**: Preventing race conditions between staff workstations
3. **Protocol Handler Security**: Validating file paths and preventing directory traversal attacks
4. **Email Delivery Reliability**: Handling SMTP failures and token expiration
5. **Database Consistency**: Maintaining referential integrity across complex workflows

### Operational Challenges:
1. **Staff Training**: Ensuring proper use of attribution system and workflow procedures
2. **Network Storage**: Coordinating shared storage access across multiple machines
3. **Backup and Recovery**: Implementing comprehensive data protection strategies
4. **System Monitoring**: Detecting and responding to operational issues
5. **Data Retention**: Managing archival and cleanup processes

### User Experience Challenges:
1. **Form Validation**: Real-time client-side validation with clear error feedback
2. **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refreshing dashboard with sound notifications
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring functionality across all device types
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance for inclusive design
5. **Error Recovery**: Clear messaging and recovery paths for all failure scenarios

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Executor Task: Authentication & Authorization

**Goal**: Implement the core authentication and authorization services for the backend, including workstation login and staff management.

**Important Authentication Design Note**: 
- The login system is **workstation-based only** - no staff name selection during login
- Staff attribution happens later in action modals (approve/reject jobs) via dropdown selection
- Login only requires `workstation_id` and `password`
- This follows the masterplan.md specification exactly

**Step-by-step Plan:**

1.  **Implement Workstation Login Endpoint**:
    *   **Action**: In `backend/app/routes/auth.py`, create the `/auth/login` endpoint. It should accept a `workstation_id` and `password`.
    *   **Logic**: For this initial version, hardcode a single valid workstation ID ("front-desk") and password ("password") in the configuration.
    *   **Success Criteria**: A `POST` request to `/api/v1/auth/login` with the correct credentials returns a JWT. Incorrect credentials return a 401 error.

2.  **Implement JWT Generation and Validation**:
    *   **Action**: Use the `PyJWT` library. Create utility functions to generate a token on successful login and to decode a token from the `Authorization` header.
    *   **Success Criteria**: The token returned from the login endpoint can be successfully decoded and contains the `workstation_id`.

3.  **Create Token-Required Decorator**:
    *   **Action**: Create a decorator (e.g., `@token_required`) that can be applied to protected endpoints. This decorator will extract the token from the header, validate it, and make the payload (containing `workstation_id`) available to the route, likely via `flask.g`.
    *   **Success Criteria**: Applying this decorator to a test endpoint makes it return a 401 error if no valid token is provided.

4.  **Implement Staff Management Endpoints (CRUD)**:
    *   **Action**: In a new blueprint (or the existing `auth` blueprint), create the `/staff` endpoints as specified in the `masterplan.md`.
        *   `GET /staff`: Returns a list of all staff (initially from the seeded data).
        *   `POST /staff`: Adds a new staff member.
        *   `PATCH /staff/<name>`: Activates/deactivates a staff member.
    *   **Protection**: All these endpoints must be protected by the `@token_required` decorator.
    *   **Success Criteria**: All four CRUD operations work as expected when a valid token is provided and fail otherwise.

5.  **Add Rate Limiting**:
    *   **Action**: Apply Flask-Limiter to the `/auth/login` endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks (e.g., 10 requests per hour).
    *   **Success Criteria**: Exceeding the rate limit on the login endpoint returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

**Executor Instructions**: The login endpoint has been implemented in `backend/app/routes/auth.py`. Please proceed with testing the login endpoint functionality before moving to Step 2. Test both valid credentials (`front-desk`/`password123`) and invalid credentials to ensure proper responses.
