## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Critical Issue Analysis: Network Connectivity Problems

**Context**: User reports "Network error, please try again" on form submission and "Failed to load jobs" in dashboard.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Backend API is running** - Container up on port 5000
2. **Frontend is running** - Next.js server accessible on port 3000  
3. **Authentication required** - Backend `/api/v1/jobs` endpoint requires JWT token (returns "Token is missing")
4. **API routing issue** - Frontend making calls to `/api/v1/*` but no Next.js API route handler exists

**Critical Problem Identified**: 
- Frontend components are calling `/api/v1/submit` and `/api/v1/jobs` directly
- These calls go to Next.js (port 3000) instead of Flask backend (port 5000)
- Next.js has no API routes configured, causing network errors
- Need API proxy configuration or base URL setup to route calls to Flask backend

**Impact**: 
- **BLOCKING** - Core functionality completely broken
- Student submissions fail entirely
- Staff dashboard cannot load any data
- System is non-functional for primary use cases

**Recommendation**: **STOP current work and fix immediately**. This is a fundamental architecture issue that blocks all API-dependent functionality. Cannot proceed with job management modals when basic API communication is broken.

**Next Action Required**: Configure API routing between Next.js frontend and Flask backend.

### Emergency Fix: API Connectivity Task Breakdown

**Goal**: Restore API communication between Next.js frontend and Flask backend to enable core system functionality.

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete before any other development work

#### Task 1: Configure Next.js API Proxy

- **Implementation**: 
  * Update `frontend/next.config.js` to include proxy rewrites
  * Route all `/api/v1/*` requests to `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/*`
  * Preserve request headers and method types
- **Success Criteria**: Next.js dev server proxies API requests to Flask backend
- **Test**: Manual verification that `/api/v1/submit` and `/api/v1/jobs` requests reach Flask
- **Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

#### Task 2: Test Student Submission API Flow
- **Action**: Verify student submission form can communicate with backend
- **Implementation**:
  * Test form submission with valid data
  * Verify file upload functionality works
  * Confirm proper error handling for validation failures
- **Success Criteria**: Form submits successfully and creates job record in database
- **Test**: Submit test job through frontend form and verify in database
- **Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

#### Task 3: Implement Dashboard Authentication Flow
- **Action**: Add authentication mechanism for dashboard API calls
- **Implementation**:
  * Create authentication context/service in frontend
  * Add login functionality for staff workstation access
  * Include JWT tokens in dashboard API requests
- **Success Criteria**: Dashboard can authenticate and load job data
- **Test**: Access dashboard, authenticate, and verify job list loads
- **Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

#### Task 4: Verify Complete API Integration
- **Action**: Test all existing API endpoints work through proxy
- **Implementation**:
  * Test job listing with various filters
  * Verify job detail retrieval
  * Test staff management endpoints
  * Confirm event logging functionality
- **Success Criteria**: All implemented API endpoints accessible through frontend
- **Test**: Manual testing of each API endpoint through browser/frontend
- **Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

**Total Estimated Time**: 1 hour 10 minutes

**Dependencies**: None - can proceed immediately

**Risk Assessment**: Low risk - standard Next.js proxy configuration with well-documented patterns

### Logged-In Workstation Flow Fix
**Context**: Login page pre-selected default station and password was mismatched, causing "Could not verify".
**Fix**:
  - Set `workstationId` initial state to `'front-desk'` in login page
  - Updated backend password for `front-desk` to `'Fabrication'`
  - Verified login via API returned a JWT token successfully:
    ```
    PS> Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login" -Method Post -Headers @{ 'Content-Type' = 'application/json' } -Body '{ "workstation_id": "front-desk", "password": "Fabrication" }'
    token: "<JWT_TOKEN_HERE>"
    ```
**Status**: Login flow fully functional.

- ✅ Improved perceived quality and trustworthiness
- ✅ Reduced development friction for future pages

**Recommendation**: **Proceed immediately with DS.1 (Login Page)** as the highest-impact, quickest win to establish momentum for the full design system rollout.

### Critical Issue Analysis: Database Connectivity Problems - RESOLVED ✅
**Context**: User updated pgAdmin and PostgreSQL; unable to connect to the database using the default `postgres` user; when Docker is running, authentication fails; when Docker is off, connection times out.
**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. The default `postgres` superuser has no password configured in the Docker container; the project uses a custom user `fablab_user` with password `fablab`.
2. When Docker is running, the Postgres container exposes port 5432 but only recognizes `fablab_user`, not `postgres`.
3. When Docker is not running, no Postgres server is listening on port 5432, causing connection timeouts.
**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ User successfully configured pgAdmin with correct credentials (`fablab_user`/`fablab`)
- ✅ Removed conflicting PostgreSQL 17 server registration from pgAdmin
- ✅ Verified database schema is properly set up with all required tables (alembic_version, event, job, payment, staff)
- ✅ Confirmed Docker containers are running and database is active
