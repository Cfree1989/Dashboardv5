# 3D Print Management System - Comprehensive Build Plan

## Background and Motivation

Based on the analysis of `masterplan.md`, `Rebuild.md`, `project-info.md`, and the system architecture diagrams, we are building a complete 3D Print Management System from absolute scratch. This system is designed for academic/makerspace environments with the following key requirements:

### Core System Requirements:
1. **Flask API-only backend** with PostgreSQL database
2. **Next.js frontend** with TypeScript and modern UI components
3. **Workstation-based authentication** with mandatory staff attribution
4. **Complete job lifecycle management** from submission to pickup
5. **File integrity and resilience** with metadata.json tracking
6. **Comprehensive audit trails** with Event logging
7. **Email notifications** and student confirmation workflows
8. **Custom protocol handler** for direct file opening in slicer software
9. **Docker-based deployment** for consistency and simplicity

### Key Design Principles:
- **Beginner-friendly implementation** with clear, step-by-step guidance
- **API-first design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Multi-user environment** supporting up to 2 staff workstations
- **File resilience** through standardized naming and metadata tracking
- **Professional UI/UX** following modern design patterns
- **Comprehensive error handling** and recovery mechanisms

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:
1. **File System Integrity**: Ensuring atomic file operations and recovery from partial failures
2. **Multi-User Concurrency**: Preventing race conditions between staff workstations
