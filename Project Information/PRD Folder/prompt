# Staff Workflow Audit Questions

## Authentication & Staff Identity Management

1. How will you handle staff turnover - what's the process when a staff member leaves or a new one joins?

2. What happens if a staff member forgets to select their name from the attribution dropdown when performing actions?

3. If multiple staff work on the same job across shifts, how will you maintain accountability and track who did what?

## File Management & System Integrity

4. If a staff member moves files manually outside the system (via Windows Explorer/File Manager), how will the system detect and recover from this inconsistency?

5. What safeguards exist if the SlicerOpener protocol handler installation fails or gets corrupted on a workstation?

6. How will you ensure staff consistently select the correct authoritative file during the approval process?

## Job Status Transitions & Handoffs

7. What mechanisms prevent a job from being "forgotten" in a particular status when shifts change?

8. If a student confirms a print job after hours, what ensures staff will notice it needs to be moved to printing when they return?

9. What happens if a staff member leaves mid-shift with partially processed jobs?

## Error Recovery & Exception Handling

10. How are print failures tracked and communicated between shifts?

11. What's your contingency plan if the staff workstation password leaks to students?

12. If a staff member makes a mistake (wrong status, wrong file, etc.), how easily can they recover without admin intervention?

## Training & Compliance

13. What ongoing training mechanisms will ensure new staff understand both the technical system and the underlying workflow principles?

14. How will you identify which staff members need additional training based on error patterns?

15. What visual cues or guardrails exist to prevent common workflow mistakes?
